IITG/ReSt License, Version 1.0
==============================

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

##Definitions
 
* `This License` refers to version 1 of the IITG/ReSt License.
* `Copyright` also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
* `The Program` refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. 
* Each licensee is addressed as `you`. 
* `Licensees` and `recipients` may be individuals or organizations.
* To `modify` a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a `modified version` of the earlier work or a work `based on` the earlier work.
* A `covered work` means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.
* To `propagate` a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
* To `convey` a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
* The `source code` for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. 
* `Object code` means any non-source form of a work.
* A `Standard Interface` means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.
* The `System Libraries` of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that 
 * is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and 
 * serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
* The `Corresponding Source` for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.
