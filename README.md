IITG/ReSt License, Version 1.0
==============================

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

##Definitions
 
* `This License` refers to version 1 of the IITG/ReSt License.

* `Copyright` also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

* `The Program` refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. 

* Each licensee is addressed as `you`. 

* `Licensees` and `recipients` may be individuals or organizations.

* To `modify` a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a `modified version` of the earlier work or a work `based on` the earlier work.

* A `covered work` means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

* To `propagate` a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

* To `convey` a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
